On May 4th, the new stable 7.0 version of
[Debian](http://www.debian.org) (code name Wheezy) was released.

Why Wheezy? [Wheezy](http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/Wheezy_(Toy_Story)) is
the name of a singing toy penguin who appears in [Toy
Story](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_Story). Traditionally, Debian
uses codenames. The next stable version of Debian will be named Jessie.

Jessie? Yes, she’s the Cowgirl (?) in Toy Story.

Oh … I almost forgot, I recommend reading the [release
notes](http://wiki.debian.org/NewInWheezy) as they provide
[information](http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/release-notes/)
on the latest version. :)
