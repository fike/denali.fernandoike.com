Ok, it’s terrible!

I also didn’t remember my  [OFTC](http://www.oftc.net/)
[IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) password. OFTC
works the same way as Freenode, but it currently hosts
[Debian](http://www.debian.org) IRC channels.

Well, I needed to recover my password, so what did I have to do?

The procedure is a little different from Freenode, only when sending
private messages to nickserv and it will send a temporary password:

    <em><strong>/msg nickserv help</strong></em>


P.S.: Thanks OFTC Staff for the tip. :)
