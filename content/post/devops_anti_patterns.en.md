title: DevOps Anti-Patterns
---
DevOps is word to use for many ways, this is happen because it 's a fashion buzzword. Then, as such is common to use DevOps incorrectly, I made a presentation show some mistakes in to use. It isn't a hunt witches but it's why happen and what to do correctly.

 The presentation has two parts, first I show examples as DevOps is applied wrongly and some thoughts what would be great. The second part is a Fishbowl meeting and I confession was a awesome experience to share knowledge each other.
