I forgot my [Freenode](http://freenode.net) password. Ok, I didn’t use
it in a long time.

Freenode is a nerd old school chat, it was (still is) text-based.
It was/is a good place for Free Software/OpenSource projects:
[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org) and
[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) are there,
[Debian](http://www.debian.org) has been there for many years.

To recover the password its is recommended to check [Freenode
FAQ](http://freenode.net/faq.shtml).  If you need a quicker way it is
very simple.  You will write to Freenode Staff in **\#freenode** channel
 with the request to reset your password. But before, you must register
the nickname with an email so Staff will send you a temporary password.

P.S.: Thanks Staff guys! :)
